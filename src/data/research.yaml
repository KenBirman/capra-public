    title: "Dahlia, a Langauge for Predictable Accelerator Design"
    summary: |
      High-level synthesis (HLS) offers a productive way to design specialized
      hardware accelerators by compiling high-level descriptions to register
      transfer level languages. Our language, Dahlia, uses a *substructural
      type system* to model hardware resources and their constraints to statically
      reject HLS designs that make unpredictable area-latency trade-offs. You
      can [try Dahlia in your browser](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/dahlia).

    title: "Braid, a Safe Heterogeneous Language for Real-Time Graphics"
    summary: |
        Braid is a programming language for *heterogeneous programming*, where a single source program targets different hardware units. We have applied it to real-time graphics programming on CPU--GPU systems. Braid compiles to WebGL, so you can [try it out in your browser](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/braid/dingus/#example=phong).
