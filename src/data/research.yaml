    title: "High-level Synthesis for Predictable Accelerator Design"
    summary: |
      Specialized hardware accelerators provide a way out of the stalling efficiency
      gains from Moore's law. However, mainstream Register Transfer Level languages
      offer ill-fitting, low level abstractions to program them.
      High-level synthesis promises to deliver high productivity, but
      does so by retooling legacy languages (C/C++). The resulting hardware
      designs are often unpredictable, containing additional hardware to implement the
      sequential semantics of C in concurrent hardware. This project aims to remedy
      this applying affine types to model hardware resources and building an
      end-to-end compiler toolchain for an new typed imperative language.

    title: "Braid, a Safe Heterogeneous Language for Real-Time Graphics"
    summary: |
        Braid is a programming language for *heterogeneous programming*, where a single source program targets different hardware units. We have applied it to real-time graphics programming on CPU--GPU systems. Braid compiles to WebGL, so you can [try it out in your browser](https://capra.cs.cornell.edu/braid/dingus/#example=phong).
