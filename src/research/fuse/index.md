longtitle: "High-level Synthesis for Predictable Accelerator Design"
order: 1
summary: |
  Specialized hardware accelerators provide a way out of the stalling efficiency
  gains from Moore's law. However, mainstream Register Transfer Level languages
  offer ill-fitting, low level abstractions to program them.
  High-level synthesis promises to deliver high productivity, but
  does so by retooling legacy systems languages such as C and C++. The resulting
  designs are often unpredictable, containing additional to implement the
  sequential semantics of C in concurrent hardware. This project aims to remedy
  this applying affine types to model hardware resources and building an
  end-to-end compiler toolchain for an imperative language.
