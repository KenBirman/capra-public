# Programming Abstractions for Natural Language &amp; Intelligent Systems

Rapid progress in machine learning has sparked a stampede toward new kinds of user interfaces based on natural interaction.
Excitement over AI-based user interfaces, however, has run ahead of the engineering tools that we need to implement them.
Engineers [complain][highinterest] of a new category of pitfalls that arise from building systems around machine learning.

We are building programming language abstractions to help manage the complexity of integrating AI with real-world applications.
Our interlocking set of abstractions, collectively called Opal, adds new features to mainstream programming languages.
